<h1>SLIMseq API</h1>

<h2>RESTful Resources</h2>
<p>This API attempts to conform to the design principles of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">Representational State 
Transfer</a> (REST), although it's a read-only interface at present, so only GET requests are 
available.</p>

<h2>Request Authentication</h2>
<p>All SLIMseq API methods require authentication. All responses are relative to the context of 
the authenticating user. Staff and Admin users will have access to all records, whereas Customer 
users will only have access to records that are available to them through the web interface.</p>
<p>For the time being, HTTP Basic Authentication is the only supported authentication scheme. 
When authenticating via Basic Auth, use your login name and password.</p>

<h2>Response Formats</h2>
<p>Output can be either JSON or XML. The desired response format can be specified either by the 
appropriate extension in the requset URI (e.g. GET http://slimseq-server/samples/100.json), or by 
providing appropriate mime-type in the request.</p>

<h2>The resources</h2>
<ul>
<% @resources.each do |r| %>
  <li><h3>Resource:  <a href="/api/<%=r.name %>"><%=r.resource_location %></a></h3></li>
<% end %>
</ul>
